      <blockquote>
        In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical
        education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian
        Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield,
        Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.
        He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at
        proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After
        rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in
        gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to
        teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket
        mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach
        basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach
        basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be
        retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored.
